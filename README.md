# OReCaP
## Focused Categorization Power of Ontologies

Focused Categorization Power (FCP) is a specific quality measure of ontologies based on class subcategorization in these ontologies. The subcategorization can be expressed via named subclasses and also compound concept expressions.

OReCaP (front-end) as a tool, and, in combination with the [FCP API](https://github.com/nvbach91/fcp-api) (back-end), allows users to use keywords to search for ontologies and from a user-selected Focus class calculate the FCP value in each relevant ontology. OReCaP also attempts to show users the process of FCP calculation, hence, users are also able to specifically view each subcategorizations in their respective categories suggested by the FCP calculation method.


This repository contains the code of the front-end (UI) part of this FCP project.
